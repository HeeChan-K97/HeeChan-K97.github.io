# My background and goal of this movement.
I was born in South Korea in 1997, the firstborn son of Kwon's family. My parents gave me the name "HeeChan," which means joyful and shining in Chinese character.
I am interested in studying physics and maths, which naturally led me to the technologic university, and UTS accepted me. UTS gave me an excellent vision for my future. As an engineer, UTS is a great place to turn my dreams come true and take me to the next level of innovation and creation.
My major is called "Mechatronics Engineering," and the word "Mechatronics" is a combination of the name "Mechanics" and "Electronics" We learn about micro-controller. Specifically, we use Arduino Uno, and it is under C language bases. Addressing pins and ports using different components such as Liquid Crystal Display[LCD], Thermometer, IR sensors, and various motors requires specific pin settings and activation codes. That is what we are learning and trying to figure out.
I want to become a specialist in my major. My motto is, "Keep going, keep trying, keep looking, and don't settle" this is not an easy journey. Still, by breaking through the obstacles throughout the journey, I will get stronger and condensed with the knowledge I deserve.
