# My background and goal of this movement.
My major is called "Mechatronics Engineering," and the word "Mechatronics" is a combination of the name "Mechanics" and "Electronics" We learn about micro-controller. 
Specifically, we use Arduino Uno, and it is under C language bases. Addressing pins and ports using different components such as Liquid Crystal Display[LCD], Thermometer, IR sensors, and various motors requires specific pin settings and activation codes. That is what we are learning and trying to figure out.
